# 🐋 WhaleRadar.ai - The Ultimate Crypto Trading Indicator Platform

> **The $900/month CoinGlass Pro API Beast Mode System**
> 
> Visual Screeners + Liquidation Heatmaps + RSI Analysis = The Triple Threat

## 🚨 CRITICAL: API ENDPOINT VERIFICATION

⚠️ **IMPORTANT**: CoinGlass API endpoints change frequently. **ALWAYS** cross-check all endpoints with the official documentation at https://docs.coinglass.com/ before implementing or debugging. The endpoints in this codebase were verified at the time of development but may have changed.

## 🚀 Overview

WhaleRadar.ai is the world's most advanced crypto trading indicator platform that combines:
- **Visual Screeners** (Price vs OI, Price vs Volume, Volume vs OI)
- **Liquidation Heatmaps** (Where the whales hunt)
- **RSI Multi-Timeframe Analysis** (Confluence confirmation)
- **1-5 Minute Alerts** (While others see at 15 minutes)
- **850+ Perpetual Coins** (Complete market coverage)

## 🎯 Core Philosophy

**"Follow the Liquidations, Not the Price"**

Whales move markets to hunt liquidation levels. This platform identifies where they're going next and helps you scale into positions across liquidation zones, so you never have to guess exact prices.

## ⚡ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11+
- CoinGlass Pro API ($900/month subscription)
- Telegram Bot Token
- Bybit API (for Phase 3 auto-trading)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/vincentortegajr/whale-radar-ai-1.git
cd whale-radar-ai-1

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API credentials
```

### Configuration

Edit the `.env` file with your credentials:

```env
# CoinGlass API Configuration (CORE SYSTEM)
COINGLASS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
COINGLASS_BASE_URL=https://open-api-v4.coinglass.com

# WhaleRadar.ai Telegram Bot Configuration
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=your_chat_id_here

# System Configuration
SCAN_INTERVAL_MINUTES=5  # How often to scan (1-5 recommended)
```

### Running the System

```bash
# Run the main scanner
python -m src.main

# Run COMPREHENSIVE deep liquidation analysis (NEW!)
python -m src.comprehensive_scanner        # Continuous scanning
python -m src.comprehensive_scanner --once # Run once and exit
python -m src.comprehensive_scanner --sample # Show sample report

# Or run specific modules
python -m src.indicators.visual_screener  # Test visual screeners
python -m src.indicators.liquidation_analyzer  # Test liquidations
python -m src.indicators.deep_liquidation_analyzer  # Deep analysis

# Run complete system test
python test_complete_system.py

# Check API authentication
python test_api_auth.py

# View logs in real-time
tail -f logs/whaleradar_*.log
```

### Quick Commands Reference

```bash
# Git workflow
git add -A && git commit -m "🐋 Update message" && git push

# Update dependencies
pip install package_name && pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Run with custom scan interval
SCAN_INTERVAL_MINUTES=1 python -m src.main

# Test individual API endpoints
python test_v4_endpoints.py
```

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. Visual Screener Analysis
The system monitors three key relationships:
- **Price vs Open Interest**: Identifies accumulation/distribution
- **Price vs Volume**: Shows momentum and participation
- **Volume vs Open Interest**: Reveals positioning intent

### 2. Liquidation Heatmap Analysis
- Uses Model 2 (most accurate for whale hunting)
- Analyzes multiple timeframes (12h, 24h, 3d, 7d, 30d, 1y)
- Identifies major liquidation clusters
- Determines whale hunting direction

### 3. RSI Confirmation
- Multi-timeframe analysis (5m to 1w)
- Identifies oversold/overbought conditions
- Confirms direction with confluence scoring

### 4. Signal Generation
When all three align:
- Momentum Score > 70
- Liquidation Direction Confirmed
- RSI Confluence > 60
= **HIGH CONFIDENCE SIGNAL**

## 🆕 COMPREHENSIVE DEEP ANALYSIS (NEW!)

The new comprehensive scanner provides:

### Top 10 Visual Screener Analysis
- Identifies the 10 most active coins from all 3 visual screeners
- Analyzes EVERY liquidation level across ALL timeframes
- Shows complete liquidation distribution (12h to 1y)
- Calculates liquidation imbalance percentages
- Predicts next whale targets with reasoning

### RSI Extreme Liquidation Verification (OPTIMIZED)
- **NEW**: Automatically excludes neutral RSI (45-55) to save API calls
- Takes top 10 RSI oversold coins (≤30)
- Takes top 10 RSI overbought coins (≥70)
- Also tracks weak (<45) and strong (>55) for comprehensive view
- Verifies if they're TRULY oversold/overbought based on liquidations
- Filters out false RSI signals using liquidation data
- Identifies the best opportunities with highest liquidation scores
- Shows API calls saved by skipping neutral zone

### Complete Data Output
- Total long/short liquidations per coin
- Major liquidation clusters with exact prices
- Scale-in zones with position sizing
- Liquidation scores (0-100)
- Direct CoinGlass links with referral: `ref=YOUR_REF`
- Direct Bybit links with referral: `ref=JWNJQWP`

## 🎯 What Makes WhaleRadar Different

### 1. **The Triple Threat Combination**
Nobody else combines Visual Screeners + Liquidation Heatmaps + RSI into ONE unified system. Each component validates the others for maximum accuracy.

### 2. **Liquidation-First Approach**
While others chase price, we follow where whales hunt liquidations. This is the REAL driver of major market moves.

### 3. **Scale-In Trading System**
Never get stopped out again. Our algorithm distributes entries across liquidation zones:
- 4 entries: [30%, 30%, 25%, 15%]
- Stop loss: Beyond major liquidation clusters
- Take profits: At opposite liquidation zones

### 4. **Speed Advantage**
- We scan every 1-5 minutes
- Competition scans every 15 minutes
- 3-15x faster signal detection

### 5. **$900/Month Pro Data**
Using CoinGlass Pro API for:
- Aggregated cross-exchange data
- 850+ perpetual pairs
- Real-time liquidation levels
- Institutional-grade accuracy
